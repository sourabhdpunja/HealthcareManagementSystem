I am Prasad Tajane and am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University.
I have two years of experience working as a Software Developer in a multinational investment firm, Nomura, at Mumbai, India.
In the tenure, I gained hands on experience on the powerful algorithmic trading technique also known as ‘High Frequency Trading’
and it bestowed me with the skills required for the implementation of real time application of algorithms.
The experience honed my Problem Solving, Coding and Logical & Structured Thinking skills.

The repository is for the the 'Web Development' course
